### Context:
This project is built off of an already existing repo, similar to one from a previous group project. The task was to add coupon functionality to the online store.

### Learning Goals:
* Write migrations to create tables and relationships between tables
* Implement CRUD functionality for a resource
* Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in serializers and controllers
* Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes
* Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application
* Write request tests that fully cover the functionality of the application
* Display data for users in a frontend application by targeting DOM elements

### Wins + Challenges:
Wins:
1. Working with a front-end that pulled data from an API
2. Styling the front-end coupons view
3. Getting the application functionality up and running<br>

Challenges:
1. Createing migrations
2. Working out the different error codes for each different create sad path
3. Diving into a front-end after not working in JavaScript in a long while
4. Figuring out what goes where and how much logic is too much logic in the controller
